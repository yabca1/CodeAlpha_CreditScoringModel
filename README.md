# Credit Scoring Model – CodeAlpha Internship

## 📌 Objective

Predict an individual's creditworthiness based on financial data using machine learning models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 📁 Dataset

A sample dataset containing:

- Age
- Income
- LoanAmount
- PaymentHistory
- Default (Target)

## 📊 ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## ⚙️ Steps Followed

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Preprocessing: handling missing values, feature scaling
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Training models
5. Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score

## 📈 Results

All three models were evaluated and compared. Random Forest performed best on the sample dataset.
